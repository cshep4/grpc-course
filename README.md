}

message AddTaskRequest {
  string task = 1;
}

message AddTaskResponse {
  string id = 1;
}

message CompleteTaskRequest {
  string id = 1;
}

}

message Task {
  string id = 1;
  string task = 1;
}
```

```bash
$ protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
--go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
proto/todo.proto

$ go run cmd/server/main.go
$ go run cmd/client/main.go
```

- Objective:
    - Create a gRPC todo application. Implement both server and client using the same generated protobuf code and make
      gRPC calls.
- Requirements:
    - Protobuf should contain a single service defintion called TodoService.
    - Will contain the following RPCs:
        - AddTask
            - AddTaskRequest message should contain a task string
            - AddTaskResponse message should contain a generated task ID
            - Will add a task to the todo list
            - Server should return InvalidArgument if task is empty
        - CompleteTask
            - CompleteTaskRequest message contains a task ID
            - CompleteTaskResponse is an empty response
            - Will remove a task from the todo list
            - Server should return InvalidArgument if task ID is empty
            - Server should return NotFound if task ID is not found
        - ListTasks
            - ListTasksRequest message is an empty request
            - ListTasksResponse message contains a list of outstanding tasks

### Exercise: Creating a file upload application

```protobuf

  rpc UploadFile(stream UploadFileRequest) returns (stream UploadFileResponse);
}

message DownloadFileRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message DownloadFileResponse {
  bytes content = 1;
}

message UploadFileRequest {
  bytes content = 1;
  bool has_more = 2;
}

message UploadFileResponse {
  string name = 1;
}
```

- Objective:
    - Implement a basic file upload service that contains two RPCs:
- UploadFile - A bi-directional streaming RPC, that uploads a file in chunks to the server, whilst the server streams
  back updates when the chunk is successfully stored.
- DownloadFile - A server streaming RPC that accepts a filename in the request and streams the file content in chunks
  back to the client.
- Requirements:
    - Both RPCs should be implemented
    - When the server receives a message, it should push to clients subscribed to the chat room, with a different
      username
    - Messages should not be pushed to the client that sent the message (e.g. clients with the same username)
    - Messages do not need to be cached/persisted
    - When a client unsubscribes, the username should be removed from the list of recipients when messages are sent
